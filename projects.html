		<h2>Custom 7-degree-of-freedom Robot arm (IN PROGRESS)</h2> 
		This project was done as part of my MASc degree requirements. The purpose of this robot arm is to serve as an experimental setup for developing control and estimation algorithms. 
		This is a retro-fitted UR5 with all custom joint electronics, shaft couplings, and mounting plates. The arm was built from scratch with the help of three other graduate students. <br>		


		<h2>Toast-E: AI powered Smart Toaster </h2>		
		My capstone project was an AI powered smart toaster running a closed loop controller for user selected crispiness level. This project was done with three other students. <br>

			<ul>
				<li>Control script written in python running on a Raspberry Pi 4</li>
				<li>Images captured every 15 seconds and put through a pre-trained CNN to determine crispiness of the toast</li>
				<li>User selects crispiness level based on a touch screen LCD where a spectrum of levels is given (we also created an app)</li>
				<li>Custom PCB housing a relay circuit for heating element control</li>
				<li>Entire toaster was built from scratch using sheet metal, glass, nichrome wire, and 3D printed componentss</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Ball and Beam Robotic Setup</h2>	
		As a robotics research assistant at the ICE lab I was tasked to create 10 ball and beam robotic systems as project kits for the MECHENG 4SS3: Smart Systems course

			<ul>
				<li>Designed and built a ball and beam robotic system from scratch</li>
				<li>Created a detailed CAD model of the setup</li>
				<li>Wrote a Arduino C++ program including data collection from a soft potentiometer, writing to a servo motor, and determining joint angles with a PID controller</li>
				<li>Created MATLAB simulations for dynamics and control validation</li>
				<li>Laser cut and 3D printed components</li>
				<li>Scaled to 11 setups total and manufactured all of them, storing in kits for students to assemble</li>
				<li>The ball and beam setups were successfully used by over 50 students as their course project (used for two years)</li>
			</ul>
